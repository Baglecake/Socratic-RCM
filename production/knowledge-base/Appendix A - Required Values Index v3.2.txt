[APPENDIX-A] Appendix A - Required Values Index v3.2
The required values, indicated by bracketed placeholders ([...]) which must be authentically conceived and specified by the student, are listed below, organized by the section in which they appear:

Section 1: Planning the Design
═══════════════════════════════
The following values are required for Section 1, encompassing the Experimental Design Template and high-level planning:

Design Structure and Variables:
* [Structure choice]
* [Theoretical Problem]
* [Option]: [A], [B], [C], [D], [E]

* [Fictional setting] (This often involves choices like [workplace], [public sphere], [democratic community of small property owners], [feudal→modernity], or [approved other])
* [Concept A] - 2-3 sentence definition from theory
* [Concept B] - 2-3 sentence definition from theory

  - [Moderator agent]
  - [Self-Reflections]
  - [Non-anthropomorphic agent]
  NOTE: [Analyst]/[Tabulator] is OPTIONAL and does NOT count toward the ≥2 requirement

Agent-Specific Values (within Section 1):
* [Agent Identifier]
* [purpose] + [name] (format for Agent Identifier, e.g., "Worker+Alice")
* [Agent Goal] - 2-3 sentences; measurable
* [Agent Persona] - 2-3 sentence behavioral summary describing how this agent behaves and makes decisions (goes in Section 2 agent prompt)
* [Agent Behaviors] - Optional behavioral heuristics for rounds (goes in Section 3 round instructions):
  - If/Then format: If [trigger], then [action] because [theory link]
  - Rival format: If [rival says X], then [update belief OR resist] with [brief reason]
  - OR custom rules: [1-2 sentences each describing unique behavioral dynamics]
  - Components:
    * [trigger] - 1 sentence describing condition
    * [action] - 1 sentence describing response
    * [theory link] - 2 sentences explaining why trigger → action follows from theory
    * [rival says X] - 1 sentence describing rival's statement
    * [update belief OR resist] - 1 sentence describing agent's reaction
    * [brief reason] - 2 sentences explaining theoretical justification
* [List] (of Agents)

Round-Specific Values (within Section 1):
* [round]
* [n] - round index number
* [round number] - the number of a specific round

* [two sentence justification for choice of variable]
* [3-sentence description of [Experiment]]

________________


Section 2: Agent Prompt Design
═══════════════════════════════
These values are required to populate the Agent Prompt Template:

* [Agent Identifier]
* [purpose] + [name] (e.g., "Worker+Alice", "Boss+Management")
* [human] / [non-human if applicable]
* [Agent Goal] - 2-3 sentences; measurable
* [Agent Persona] - 2-3 sentence behavioral summary
* [forbidden behaviors]

Note: Agent Persona is a concise behavioral summary that goes directly in the agent's system prompt. It describes HOW the agent behaves and makes decisions in general terms.

________________


Section 3: Round Custom Instructions Design
════════════════════════════════════════════
These values are required to populate the Round Custom Instructions Template and configure Chatstorm platform settings:

Round Instructions Content:
* [round number] — [title]
* [Detailed setting description tied to theory; 4-5 sentences] (SCENARIO)
* [Concept A; 2-3 sentences] - Round-specific application
* [Concept B; 2-3 sentences] - Round-specific application
* [Concept A vs Concept B tension]
* [outline of roles; 1-2 sentences per role]
* [AGENT BEHAVIORS] - Optional governing heuristics for this round:
  - If [trigger], then [action] because [theory link]
  - If [rival says X], then [update belief OR resist] with [brief reason]
  - OR custom behavioral rules (1-2 sentences each)
* [specific actions]
* [INTERACTION RULES]
* [forbidden behaviors] (e.g., agent drift / changing identity / changing rules)
* [SEQUENCE] - How the round is to play out (student inputs sequence of dynamics)
* [student specifies frame + rules; 2-3 sentences]
* [student specifies: outline of roles and interactions]
* [Student describes: SCENARIO; 2-3+ sentences]
* [student indicates yes/no and defines the trigger in 1-2 sentences]

Note: Agent Behaviors are OPTIONAL but recommended. They govern how agents act within the specific context of this round. Use If/Then and Rival formats for theory-driven heuristics, OR describe unique behavioral dynamics in 1-2 sentences per rule.

Chatstorm Platform Configuration (per round):

PARTICIPANTS:
* [Agents in this round] - List of Agent Identifiers participating

FLOW:
* [Who can send messages] - All participants OR Moderator decides
* [Participant Order] - Default / Random / Let active agent decide / Let moderator decide
  * If moderator decides: [moderator agent name]
* [End the round] - Choose ONE option:
  * Option 1: After total # of messages → [number]
  * Option 2: After # per participant → [number]
  * Option 3: After moderator decides → [moderator name], [max messages], [END ROUND INSTRUCTIONS; 2-3 sentences]
* [Transition] - Pause / Automatically start / Let moderator decide

STYLE:
* [Response Detail] - Minimal / Brief / Medium / Thorough / Exhaustive / Dynamic
* [Creativity] - Use agent defaults OR Custom (Precise / Standard / Creative / Dynamic / Experimental)

OPTIONS:
* [Custom Instructions] - Paste Section 3 round instructions here
* [Agent Settings] - Checkboxes:
  * Ask Questions
  * Self-Reflection (if using this advanced function for this round)
  * Isolated Messages
* [Model Selection] - Use agent defaults (recommended) OR DeepSeek42

________________


Section 4: Helper Templates
════════════════════════════
These values are required for the specific helper templates if the student chooses to use them:

1. Analyst/Tabulator Template Required Values
* [Concept A] (from Section 1)
* [Concept B] (from Section 1)
* [Outcome1] (from Section 1)
* [Outcome2] (from Section 1)

2. Moderator Template Required Values
* [target concept] - specified as either [Concept A] or [Concept B] from Section 1
* [END ROUND INSTRUCTIONS] - 2-3 sentences describing specific conditions for ending the round (aligns with Section 3 Flow settings)

3. Self-Reflections Configuration (NOT A TEMPLATE)
* Self-Reflections are enabled by checking "Self-Reflection" in Round Panel → Options → Agent Settings
* No required values - it's a platform feature
* When enabled, agents automatically use <SELF> tags for internal thoughts

4. Non-Anthropomorphic Agent Required Values
* [student input (a); 2-3 sentences] (Role - e.g., "The State," "Public Opinion," "The Gun")
* [student input (b); 1-2 sentences] (Trigger - what activates the signal)
* [name] (Label/name of the non-anthropomorphic agent)
* [brief text] - signal description
* [A], [B], [...] (The list of affected agents by identifier)
* ["A"], ["B"], [...] (Unique Agent Identifier for affected agents)

CROSS-SECTION FIELD NOTES
══════════════════════════

Fields that appear in multiple sections:

† [Agent Identifier] - Defined in Section 1, used in Sections 2, 3, 4
† [Agent Persona] - Defined in Section 1, used in Section 2 (agent prompt)
† [Agent Behaviors] - Defined in Section 1, used in Section 3 (round instructions) - OPTIONAL
† [Concept A] & [Concept B] - Defined in Section 1, applied in Section 3, referenced in Section 4
† [theory link] - Used in Sections 1, 3 for behavioral heuristics
† END CONDITION has two forms:
  - [END ROUND INSTRUCTIONS]: 2-3 sentences in moderator prompt (Section 4) and Chatstorm Flow settings (Section 3)
  - Platform end settings: Configured per round in Chatstorm Flow (Section 3)

KEY DISTINCTION:
• [Agent Persona] = General behavioral summary in agent's system prompt (Section 2)
• [Agent Behaviors] = Round-specific behavioral heuristics in round instructions (Section 3)

The persona describes WHO the agent is and HOW they generally behave.
The behaviors govern WHAT RULES they follow in a specific round context.
