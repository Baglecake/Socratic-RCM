✅ Ready for OpenAI GPT Builder

## 📋 SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Access OpenAI GPT Builder
1. Go to: https://chat.openai.com/gpts/editor
2. Click "Create" to start a new GPT
3. Or edit your existing B42 Chatstorm T.A. GPT

### Step 2: Configure Basic Settings
**Name:** B42 Chatstorm T.A.
**Description:** Socratic assistant for SOCB42 students designing multi-agent experiments in Chatstorm

### Step 3: Upload Knowledge Base Files
In the "Knowledge" section, upload these 4 files:
1. B42 Chatstorm T.A. Guide v3.txt
2. B42 Final Project.txt
3. B42 Step-by-Step Guide to Your Final Project.txt
4. Final Project Submission Template.txt (if you have it)

### Step 4: Paste System Instructions
1. Open: B42 Chatstorm TA System Prompt v6-FINAL.txt
2. Copy ALL contents
3. Paste into "Instructions" field in GPT Builder
4. Click "Save"

**VERIFY:** You should see character count around 5,446 - NO error about exceeding limit

### Step 5: Configure Capabilities
**Enable:**
- ✅ Web Browsing: NO
- ✅ DALL·E Image Generation: NO
- ✅ Code Interpreter: NO

**Conversation starters (optional):**
- "I'm ready to start planning my experiment"
- "Help me understand the assignment options"
- "I need to create agent prompts"
- "How do I structure my rounds?"

### Step 6: Test the GPT
**Test Message 1:**
"I want to work on Option A: Class and Gender"

**Expected Response:**
Should ask: "Have you completed your storyboard? (yes/no)"
Should show: "Phase 1, Step 1.1"

**Test Message 2:**
"Yes, I have my storyboard"

**Expected Response:**
Should proceed to Step 1.2 and ask about theoretical problem

**Test Message 3 (Vague Response Test):**
"The agent wants to win"

**Expected Response:**
Should STOP and ask for measurable goal with reference to their setting and KB[2]

## ✅ WHAT'S FIXED IN V6

### 1. SIZE ISSUE ✅
- v4: 8,229 chars (TOO BIG)
- v6: 5,446 chars (FITS!)

### 2. WORKFLOW STRUCTURE ✅
Now follows: Big Picture → Details
- Framework BEFORE agent details
- Round structure BEFORE round prompts
- Agent roster BEFORE individual agent deep dives

### 3. AGENT IDENTIFIER ✅
Clearly states: Format: [purpose]+[name] (e.g., 'Worker+Alice')
No more confusion

### 4. ANALYST CLASSIFICATION ✅
Step 1.7 now includes NOTE:
"Analyst/Tabulator is Section 4 helper, NOT advanced function"

### 5. SOCRATIC METHOD ✅
Every example now connects to:
- Student's prior inputs
- Assignment requirements (KB[2])
- Theoretical goals

### 6. ASSIGNMENT CHECK-INS ✅
Checkpoints after every major step:
- "Review KB[2]—does this align?"
- "Check KB[2] Option [X]"
- Final CRITICAL REVIEW section

## 🚨 COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue: "Character limit exceeded"
**Solution:** Make sure you're using v6-FINAL.txt (5,446 chars), NOT v4 (8,229 chars)

### Issue: "GPT is still creating content for students"
**Solution:** Check that ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS section is present at top of instructions

### Issue: "Not asking about storyboard first"
**Solution:** Verify Step 1.1 is intact in the pasted instructions

### Issue: "Knowledge base files not found"
**Solution:** Confirm all 4 KB files are uploaded in "Knowledge" section

### Issue: "Agent Identifier still confusing"
**Solution:** Check Step 1.6 includes example: "e.g., 'Worker+Alice'"

## 📊 HOW TO VERIFY IT'S WORKING

### ✅ Green Flags (Good Signs):
- Always shows "Phase X, Step Y.Z" position
- Asks ONE question at a time
- References KB[2] or KB[3] in checkpoints
- Refuses to write creative content when asked
- Stops and asks for clarification when student is vague
- Asks about framework BEFORE asking for detailed agent prompts

### 🚩 Red Flags (Issues):
- Suggests wording for students
- Fills in [...] placeholders with its own ideas
- Accepts "sounds good" as an answer
- Jumps straight to agent prompts without Section 1
- Doesn't reference KB files
- Skips checkpoints
