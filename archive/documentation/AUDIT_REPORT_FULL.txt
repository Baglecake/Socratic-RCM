CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE FIX
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. ❌ UNDEFINED FIELD: [Agent Designator]
   Location: Lines 196, 579
   Problem: Field used but never defined; appears to be typo for [Agent Identifier]
   Impact: Students won't know what this means
   Fix: Replace with [Agent Identifier]

2. ❌ CAPITALIZATION CHAOS: [concept A/B] vs [Concept A/B]
   Location: Throughout document
   Problem: Used interchangeably - unclear if same field or different
   Impact: Confusion about when to define concepts
   Fix: Standardize capitalization + add [Concept A/B] to Section 1

3. ❌ MISSING DEFINITIONS: [baseline value] & [experimental value]
   Location: Lines 196, 579
   Problem: Listed as experimental lever variables but never defined
   Impact: Students won't know what constitutes a "value"
   Fix: Add definitions to Appendix A

4. ❌ ORPHANED FIELD: Speaking Order
   Location: Line 623 (Appendix A)
   Problem: Defined in Appendix but not used in any template
   Impact: Students expect field that doesn't exist
   Fix: Remove from Appendix OR add to Section 3 template

5. ❌ STRUCTURAL ERROR: Round Instructions in Section 1
   Location: Lines 172-186
   Problem: CONTEXT RULES, INTERACTION RULES, TASKS appear in both Section 1 and Section 3
   Impact: Duplication, confusion about what goes where
   Fix: Remove from Section 1 (belongs only in Section 3)

6. ❌ SENTENCE LENGTH INCONSISTENCY
   Location: Throughout document
   Problem: Same types of fields have different requirements (2-3 vs 2-4 vs 4-5 sentences)
   Impact: Confusion about expectations
   Fix: Standardize to 2-3 sentences for similar fields

7. ❌ MISSING FIELD: [Concept A/B] Not in Section 1
   Location: Section 1, Section 4
   Problem: Section 4 templates require [Concept A/B] but Section 1 never asks students to define them
   Impact: No student input available when needed
   Fix: Add [Concept A] and [Concept B] fields to Section 1

8. ❌ AMBIGUOUS: "Student must pick ≥2 overall"
   Location: Line 208
   Problem: "overall" could mean per section or total project
   Impact: Students may over-select advanced functions
   Fix: Clarify "at least 2 for the entire project"

9. ❌ [Agent Descriptor] SCOPE CONFUSION
   Location: Lines 160, 312, 322, 607
   Problem: Sometimes means "2-4 adjectives" sometimes means "adjectives + If/Then heuristics"
   Impact: Critical - students won't know what to provide
   Fix: Split into [Agent Descriptor - Style] and [Agent Descriptor - Heuristics]

10. ❌ SECTION 2 TEMPLATE MISSING HEURISTICS
    Location: Line 322
    Problem: Template has PERSONA & HEURISTICS header but only asks for adjectives
    Impact: If/Then and Rival heuristics have no place in agent prompts
    Fix: Expand Section 2 template to include heuristic fields

INCONSISTENCIES TO RESOLVE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

11. ⚠️  ANALYST CLASSIFICATION CONFUSION
    Problem: Analyst presented as optional helper BUT also listed alongside agents
    Location: Lines 25, 113-114, 119, 167, 439
    Fix: Explicit note that Analyst is optional, NOT counted toward "≥2 Advanced Functions"

12. ⚠️  BRACKET SYNTAX ERRORS
    Location: Lines 103, 119, 208, 556
    Problem: Double opening brackets [[Advanced Functions] should be single [Advanced Functions]
    Fix: Remove extra opening bracket

13. ⚠️  ROUND PLAN SYNTAX ERRORS
    Location: Line 103
    Problem: Triple closing brackets ]]], inconsistent spacing [ n+2]
    Fix: Correct to single bracket, remove spaces

14. ⚠️  CIRCULAR REFERENCE: [Participants]
    Location: Lines 220-221
    Problem: [Participants] defined as [Agents Involved] which references [Participants]
    Fix: Clarify [Participants] = selection from [Agents Involved] list

15. ⚠️  END CONDITION APPEARS 3X WITH DIFFERENT MEANINGS
    Location: Lines 267-271, 388, 482
    Problem: Same field name for Platform setting, Round instruction, Moderator instruction
    Fix: Use different names for each context

16. ⚠️  [Flow] - [List] UNCLEAR NOTATION
    Location: Line 224
    Problem: Not clear what "- [List]" means
    Fix: Remove or clarify

17. ⚠️  CHATSTORM SPELLING INCONSISTENCY
    Location: Throughout document
    Problem: "Chatstorm" vs "ChatStorm" (capital S)
    Fix: Standardize to "Chatstorm"

18. ⚠️  [number] OVERLOADING
    Location: Throughout document
    Problem: Used for round number, agent count, message count, numeric values
    Fix: Use specific field names [round number], [agent count], [message count]

19. ⚠️  MISSING: Self-Reflections Template
    Location: Section 4
    Problem: Listed as Advanced Function but no Section 4 template provided
    Fix: Add [S4-SELFREFLECT] template

20. ⚠️  SECTION NUMBERING ERROR
    Location: Line 392
    Problem: "1) Required Values" then jumps to "3) Template" - missing 2
    Fix: Change to "2) Template"

21. ⚠️  MULTIPLE "REQUIRED VALUES" DEFINITIONS
    Location: Lines 70, 90, 303
    Problem: Term used as both section header and component reference
    Fix: Clarify usage

23. ⚠️  "SEE SECTION 1" REFERENCES INACCURATE
    Location: Lines 457, 480, 502
    Problem: Claims fields are in Section 1 when they're not
    Fix: Update references or add missing fields to Section 1

24. ⚠️  PHRASING VARIATIONS
    Location: Throughout document

    Problem: Appears in both INTERACTION RULES and TASKS THIS ROUND
    Fix: Clarify distinction

28. ⚠️  TYPE A/B EXPERIMENT NAMING
    Location: Lines 84-206
    Problem: Called "A" and "B" but never "Type A" or "Type B" explicitly
    Fix: Either name them explicitly or remove A/B designation

IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

34. 💡 [SEQUENCE] MEANING UNCLEAR
    Problem: Not clear how it differs from INTERACTION RULES or SCENARIO
    Recommendation: Rename to [ROUND FLOW], make steps conditional

35. 💡 [theory link] NEVER DEFINED
    Problem: Used in If/Then heuristics but students may interpret differently
    Recommendation: Add to Appendix A with clear definition

36. 💡 MISSING: Multi-Round Flow Guidance

    Recommendation: Standardize to no internal spaces, spaces around operators

45. 💡 NO SUBMISSION TEMPLATE INTEGRATION
    Problem: Doesn't explain how Guide v3 outputs become submission deliverables
    Recommendation: Add "Preparing Your Submission" section

46. 💡 NO ALIGNMENT WITH GRADING
