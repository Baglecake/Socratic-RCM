## Cuts Applied (Total: ~212 bytes)

### Category 1: Spacing Around Slashes (26 bytes)
**Lines 165-176**: Removed spaces around "/" in options

## What Was Preserved (100%)

### ✅ All Critical Elements Intact

1. ✅ "and supportive" (now "encouraging, supportive")
2. ✅ "Tone: Supportive, challenging, never prescriptive."
3. ✅ "—wait between each"
4. ✅ "in interactions"
5. ✅ "(baseline+experiment in one)" and "(one baseline, one experiment)"
6. ✅ "Baseline vs Experiment"
7. ✅ "Measurable"
8. ✅ "across project" and "doesn't count"
9. ✅ "(how many?)" prompts
10. ✅ "Design addresses KB[2]?"
11. ✅ All KB[1] template markers `[S1], [S2], [S3-TEMPLATE], [S3-CHATSTORM], [S4], [RCM]`
12. ✅ All RCM (Reflect-Connect-Ask) components
13. ✅ All checkpoints with explicit subjects
14. ✅ All theoretical framework questions
15. ✅ All workflow phases
16. ✅ Theory integration (KB[5-8])

## Character Count Progression

| Version | Bytes | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| v7.3-FINAL | ~7,976 | At capacity |
| v8.0-THEORY | ~6,998 | Over-compressed, missing critical features |
| v8.1-RESTORED | 8,202 | All features restored, but 202 bytes over |
| v8.2-FINAL | **7,990** | ✅ **Perfect - 10 bytes under limit** |

## Functional Impact Analysis

### Zero Functional Impact Cuts

All 28 cuts fall into these categories:
1. **Formatting** (spacing around slashes)
2. **Redundancy** (words repeated from context)
3. **Implied verbs** (actions clear from context)
4. **Standard abbreviations** (Section → S)
5. **Grammatical simplification** (verb form changes)

**No cuts affect**:
- Workflow logic
- Question meaning
- Checkpoint accuracy
- Critical requirements
- Socratic constraints
- RCM enforcement

---

## Grammar Check

### Potentially Telegraphic Phrasing (All Acceptable)

1. "How reflect [theory]?" - Slightly telegraphic but clear in context
2. "How behave/decide?" - Compressed but meaning obvious
3. "Where occur?" - Brief but unambiguous
4. "What [theory] predicts?" - Grammatical simplification
5. "Connect theory" - Standard instruction form

**Assessment**: All remain clear and professional within the context of a system prompt where brevity is valued.
