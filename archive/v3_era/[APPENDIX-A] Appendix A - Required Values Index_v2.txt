[APPENDIX-A] Appendix A - Required Values Index
The required values, indicated by bracketed placeholders ([...]) which must be authentically conceived and specified by the student, are listed below, organized by the section in which they appear:
Section 1: Planning the Design
The following values are required for Section 1, encompassing the Experimental Design Template, Required Values, and Platform Functions:
Design Structure and Variables:
* [Structure choice]
* [Theoretical Problem]
* [Option]: [[A],[B],[C],[D],[E]]
* [Goal of the project]
* [Fictional setting] (This often involves choices like [workplace], [public sphere], [democratic community of small property owners], [feudal→modernity], or [approved other;]).
* [Agents Involved]
* [Round plan]
* [Analyst]
* [Tabulator]
* [Outcomes]
* [Outcome1]
* [Outcome2]
* [short hypothesis]
* [Baseline]
* [Experimental lever]
* [Experiment]
* [[Advanced Functions] (Choices include [Moderator agent], [Self-Reflections], [Non-anthropomorphic agent]]).
Agent-Specific Values (within Section 1):
* [Agent Identifier]
* [[purpose]+[name]] (for Agent Identifier)
* [Agent Goal]
* [Agent Descriptor]
* [Style]: [2–4 adjectives]
* [trigger] (for If/Then heuristic)
* [action] (for If/Then heuristic)
* [theory link] (for If/Then heuristic)
* [rival says X]
* [update belief OR resist]
* [brief reason]
* [List] (of Agents)
* [number] (of Agents)
* [human]
* [non-human if applicable]
Round-Specific Values (within Section 1):
* [round]
* [n]
* [name] (attached to round)
* [purpose] (attached to round or other values)
Experiment Type Modifiers:
* [Experimental lever] Variables (which can include [[round] + [purpose], [Agent Designator and Agent Descriptor], [baseline value], [experimental value], [other modifier as specified by the student]]).
* [student justifies their decision for “A” in 3-sentences]
* [two sentence justification for choice of variable]
* [3-sentence description of [Experiment]]
Platform Functions and Flow:
* [Participants]
* [Flow] - [List]
* [Who can send messages?]: (requires [yes/no])
* [Participant Order]: (requires [yes/no] for options like Default, Random, Let the active agent decide, Let a moderator decide).
* [End the round]: (requires [number] or [yes/no]).
* [number] (for total messages or messages per participant)
* [Transition]: (requires [yes/no] for options like Pause for the user, Automatically start, Let a moderator decide).
* [Style]: (Choice of [Minimal], [Brief], [Medium], [Thorough], [Exhaustive], [Dynamic]).
* [Creativity]: (Choice of [Precise], [Standard], [Creative], [Dynamic], [Experimental]).
* [END CONDITION].
* [student conceived and specified condition; 1-2 sentences].

Section 2: Agent Prompt Design
These values are required to populate the Agent Prompt Template:
* [Agent Identifier]
* [[purpose]+[name]]
* [human] / [non-human if applicable]
* [Agent Goal]
* [Agent Descriptor]
* [2–4 adjectives]
* [forbidden behaviours]
Note: The bracketed placeholders for the "If [trigger], then [action] because [theory link]" and "If [rival says X], then [update belief OR resist] with [brief reason]" are also required, as they are part of the [Agent Descriptor] specified in Section 1 and referenced in the Section 2 Template.

Section 3: Round Custom Instructions Design
These values are required to populate the Round Custom Instructions Template:
* [number] — [title]
* [Detailed setting description [theory link]: 4-5 sentences] (SCENARIO)
* [concept A; 2-3 sentences]
* [concept B; 2-3 sentences]
* [concept A vs concept B tension]
* [outline of roles; 1-2 sentences per role]
* [trigger], [action], [theory link] (If/Then heuristic)
* [rival says X], [update belief OR resist], [brief reason] (Rival heuristic)
* [specific actions]
* [INTERACTION RULES]
* [student specifies: Moderator sets / fixed list / free-for-all] (Speaking order)
* [student specifies: e.g., agent drift / changing identity / changing rules] (Forbidden behaviors)
* [SEQUENCE – How the round is to play out - student inputs their ideas as a sequence of dynamics...]
* [student specifies frame + rules; 2-3 sentences]
* [student specifies: outline of roles and interactions]
* [Student describes: SCENARIO; 2-3+ sentences]
* [student indicates yes/no and defines the trigger in 1-2 sentences]
* [student conceived condition that will end the round; 1-2 sentences] (END CONDITION).

* [Concept A]
* [Concept B]
* [Outcome1]
* [Outcome2]
2. Moderator Template Required Values
* [target concept] (specified as one of either [Concept A] or [Concept B]).
* [END CONDITION]
* [student conceived and specified condition; 1-2 sentences]
3. Non-Anthropomorphic Agent Required Values
