  NOTE: [Analyst]/[Tabulator] is OPTIONAL and does NOT count toward the ≥2 requirement

Agent-Specific Values (within Section 1):
* [Agent Identifier]

  - OR custom rules: [1-2 sentences each describing unique behavioral dynamics]
  - Components:
    * [trigger] - 1 sentence describing condition
    * [action] - 1 sentence describing response
    * [theory link] - 2 sentences explaining why trigger → action follows from theory
    * [rival says X] - 1 sentence describing rival's statement
    * [update belief OR resist] - 1 sentence describing agent's reaction

Round-Specific Values (within Section 1):
* [round]

* [two sentence justification for choice of variable]
* [3-sentence description of [Experiment]]

Platform Functions and Flow:
* [Participants] - Selected from the [Agents Involved] list
* [Flow] - List of settings:
  * [Who can send messages?]: requires [yes/no]
  * [Participant Order]: requires [yes/no] for options (Default, Random, Let the active agent decide, Let a moderator decide)
  * [End the round]: requires [message count] or [yes/no]
  * [Transition]: requires [yes/no] for options (Pause for the user, Automatically start, Let a moderator decide)
* [message count] (for total messages or messages per participant)
* [Style]: Choice of [Minimal], [Brief], [Medium], [Thorough], [Exhaustive], [Dynamic]
* [Creativity]: Choice of [Precise], [Standard], [Creative], [Dynamic], [Experimental]
* [End Round Setting] (Platform function) - 1-2 sentences

Section 2: Agent Prompt Design
═══════════════════════════════
These values are required to populate the Agent Prompt Template:

* [Agent Identifier]
* [purpose] + [name] (e.g., "Worker+Alice", "Boss+Management")
* [human] / [non-human if applicable]
* [Agent Goal] - 2-3 sentences; measurable
* [Agent Persona] - 2-3 sentence behavioral summary
* [forbidden behaviors]

Note: Agent Persona is a concise behavioral summary that goes directly in the agent's system prompt. It describes HOW the agent behaves and makes decisions in general terms.

________________


Section 3: Round Custom Instructions Design
════════════════════════════════════════════
These values are required to populate the Round Custom Instructions Template:

* [round number] — [title]
* [Detailed setting description tied to theory; 4-5 sentences] (SCENARIO)
* [Concept A; 2-3 sentences] - Round-specific application
* [Concept B; 2-3 sentences] - Round-specific application
* [Concept A vs Concept B tension]
* [outline of roles; 1-2 sentences per role]
* [AGENT BEHAVIORS] - Optional governing heuristics for this round:
  - If [trigger], then [action] because [theory link]
  - If [rival says X], then [update belief OR resist] with [brief reason]
  - OR custom behavioral rules (1-2 sentences each)
* [specific actions]
* [INTERACTION RULES]
* [forbidden behaviors] (e.g., agent drift / changing identity / changing rules)
* [SEQUENCE] - How the round is to play out (student inputs sequence of dynamics)
* [student specifies frame + rules; 2-3 sentences]
* [student specifies: outline of roles and interactions]
* [Student describes: SCENARIO; 2-3+ sentences]
* [student indicates yes/no and defines the trigger in 1-2 sentences]
* [Round Ending Instructions] (prompt-based) - 1-2 sentences explaining how round will end

Note: Agent Behaviors are OPTIONAL but recommended. They govern how agents act within the specific context of this round. Use If/Then and Rival formats for theory-driven heuristics, OR describe unique behavioral dynamics in 1-2 sentences per rule.

________________


Section 4: Helper Templates
════════════════════════════
These values are required for the specific helper templates if the student chooses to use them:

1. Analyst/Tabulator Template Required Values
* [Concept A] (from Section 1)
* [Concept B] (from Section 1)
* [Outcome1] (from Section 1)
* [Outcome2] (from Section 1)

2. Moderator Template Required Values
* [target concept] - specified as either [Concept A] or [Concept B] from Section 1
* [Moderator End Criteria] (Moderator-specific) - 1-2 sentences for when moderator should end the round

3. Self-Reflections Template Required Values
* [reflection frequency] - after each turn / at specific triggers / end of round
* [reflection prompt] - what agents should reflect on (e.g., "internal motivations vs public actions")

4. Non-Anthropomorphic Agent Required Values
* [student input (a); 2-3 sentences] (Role - e.g., "The State," "Public Opinion," "The Gun")
* [student input (b); 1-2 sentences] (Trigger - what activates the signal)
* [name] (Label/name of the non-anthropomorphic agent)
* [brief text] - signal description
* [A], [B], [...] (The list of affected agents by identifier)
* ["A"], ["B"], [...] (Unique Agent Identifier for affected agents)

CROSS-SECTION FIELD NOTES
══════════════════════════

Fields that appear in multiple sections:

† [Agent Identifier] - Defined in Section 1, used in Sections 2, 3, 4
† [Agent Persona] - Defined in Section 1, used in Section 2 (agent prompt)
† [Agent Behaviors] - Defined in Section 1, used in Section 3 (round instructions) - OPTIONAL
† [Concept A] & [Concept B] - Defined in Section 1, applied in Section 3, referenced in Section 4
† [theory link] - Used in Sections 1, 3 for behavioral heuristics
† END CONDITION has three forms:
  - [End Round Setting]: Platform function (Section 1)
  - [Round Ending Instructions]: Prompt-based (Section 3)
  - [Moderator End Criteria]: Moderator-specific (Section 4)

KEY DISTINCTION:
• [Agent Persona] = General behavioral summary in agent's system prompt (Section 2)
• [Agent Behaviors] = Round-specific behavioral heuristics in round instructions (Section 3)

The persona describes WHO the agent is and HOW they generally behave.
The behaviors govern WHAT RULES they follow in a specific round context.
