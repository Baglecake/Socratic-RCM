* [List] (of Agents)

Round-Specific Values (within Section 1):
* [round]

* [round number] - the number of a specific round
* [name] (attached to round)
* [purpose] (attached to round or other values)

Experiment Type Modifiers:
* [Experimental lever] Variables (which can include: [round] + [purpose], [Agent Identifier] and [Agent Descriptor], [baseline value], [experimental value], [other modifier])
* [student justifies their decision for "A" in 3 sentences]
* [two sentence justification for choice of variable]
* [3-sentence description of [Experiment]]

Platform Functions and Flow:
* [Participants] - Selected from the [Agents Involved] list
* [Flow] - List of settings:
  * [Who can send messages?]: requires [yes/no]
  * [Participant Order]: requires [yes/no] for options (Default, Random, Let the active agent decide, Let a moderator decide)
  * [End the round]: requires [message count] or [yes/no]
  * [Transition]: requires [yes/no] for options (Pause for the user, Automatically start, Let a moderator decide)
* [message count] (for total messages or messages per participant)
* [Style]: Choice of [Minimal], [Brief], [Medium], [Thorough], [Exhaustive], [Dynamic]
* [Creativity]: Choice of [Precise], [Standard], [Creative], [Dynamic], [Experimental]
* [End Round Setting] (Platform function) - 1-2 sentences

Section 2: Agent Prompt Design
═══════════════════════════════
These values are required to populate the Agent Prompt Template:

* [Agent Identifier]
* [purpose] + [name] (e.g., "Worker+Alice", "Boss+Management")
* [human] / [non-human if applicable]
* [Agent Goal] - 2-3 sentences; measurable
* [Agent Descriptor - Style]: 2-4 adjectives
* [Agent Descriptor - Heuristics]:
  - If [trigger], then [action] because [theory link]
  - If [rival says X], then [update belief OR resist] with [brief reason]
* [forbidden behaviors]

Note: The [Agent Descriptor - Heuristics] includes If/Then and Rival structures that were specified in Section 1 and are now incorporated into the agent prompt.

________________


Section 3: Round Custom Instructions Design
════════════════════════════════════════════
These values are required to populate the Round Custom Instructions Template:

* [round number] — [title]
* [Detailed setting description tied to theory; 4-5 sentences] (SCENARIO)
* [Concept A; 2-3 sentences] - Round-specific application
* [Concept B; 2-3 sentences] - Round-specific application
* [Concept A vs Concept B tension]
* [outline of roles; 1-2 sentences per role]
* [trigger], [action], [theory link] (If/Then heuristic)
* [rival says X], [update belief OR resist], [brief reason] (Rival heuristic)
* [specific actions]
* [INTERACTION RULES]
* [forbidden behaviors] (e.g., agent drift / changing identity / changing rules)
* [SEQUENCE] - How the round is to play out (student inputs sequence of dynamics)
* [student specifies frame + rules; 2-3 sentences]
* [student specifies: outline of roles and interactions]
* [Student describes: SCENARIO; 2-3+ sentences]
* [student indicates yes/no and defines the trigger in 1-2 sentences]
* [Round Ending Instructions] (prompt-based) - 1-2 sentences explaining how round will end

3. Self-Reflections Template Required Values
* [reflection frequency] - after each turn / at specific triggers / end of round
* [reflection prompt] - what agents should reflect on (e.g., "internal motivations vs public actions")

4. Non-Anthropomorphic Agent Required Values
* [student input (a); 2-3 sentences] (Role - e.g., "The State," "Public Opinion," "The Gun")
* [student input (b); 1-2 sentences] (Trigger - what activates the signal)
* [name] (Label/name of the non-anthropomorphic agent)
* [brief text] - signal description
