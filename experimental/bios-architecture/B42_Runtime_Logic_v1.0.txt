REQUIRED OUTPUT: "Have you completed your storyboard? (yes/no)"
RCM CUE: N/A (yes/no question)
CONSTRAINT: Accept yes/no only. If no, say "I recommend completing it first, but you may proceed if you prefer."
NEXT STEP: 1.2.1

### [STEP 1.2.1]
TARGET: Theoretical Option Selection

---

### [STEP 1.2.2]
TARGET: Project Goal Definition
INSTRUCTION: Ask student to define their core research question/dynamic in theoretical terms.
REQUIRED OUTPUT: "Project goal: What question/dynamic will you model? Think theoretically—what tension? (2-3 sent.)"
RCM CUE:
- Reflect: "Think about the core tension between your two theorists"

- Ask: "Can you state this in 2-3 sentences?"
CONSTRAINT:
- Must be 2-3 sentences

---

### [STEP 1.2.3]
TARGET: Concept A Definition
INSTRUCTION: Ask student to define the first concept in their theoretical tension.
REQUIRED OUTPUT: "[Concept A]: Define from [theory]. How manifest in interactions? (2-3 sent.)"
- Replace [Concept A] with the actual concept name from their chosen option
- Replace [theory] with the theorist name (Marx, Tocqueville, Wollstonecraft, Smith)
RCM CUE:
- Reflect: "What are the key features of [Concept A]?"

TARGET: Experiment Structure Choice
INSTRUCTION: Ask student to choose between single multi-round design OR two separate designs.
REQUIRED OUTPUT: "Structure: Single multi-round design (baseline+experiment in one) OR two separate designs (one baseline, one experiment)? Which tests [A] vs [B] best?"
- Replace [A] and [B] with actual concept names
RCM CUE:
- If no reasoning given: "Why does this structure best test the tension between [A] and [B]?"
- If reasoning given: Acknowledge and proceed to next step
CONSTRAINT:
- Must choose one structure
- If reasoning is provided with answer: Acknowledge it and go to Step 1.2.6 immediately
- If no reasoning: Record choice and continue
REASONING PROTOCOL:
- If student provides detailed reasoning with their choice → "Great! You've chosen [structure] with clear reasoning. Let's move to 1.2.6..."
- If student only states choice → Record and continue without re-asking
NEXT STEP: 1.2.6
