# B42 Chatstorm Runtime Logic - Phase 2: Drafting

This file contains Phase 2 step-by-step instructions for the B42 Chatstorm BIOS.
The BIOS will retrieve and execute steps from this file during Phase 2.

**Phase**: 2 - DRAFTING
**Steps**: 2.1 through 2.3
**Purpose**: Create agent prompts, round instructions, and helper templates

## PHASE 2: DRAFTING

### [STEP 2.1.1]
TARGET: Agent Prompt Creation (Iterative - per agent)
INSTRUCTION: For each agent, create their agent prompt using KB[1] [S2-TEMPLATE].
REQUIRED OUTPUT:
"Let's create the prompt for [Identifier]. Using KB[1] [S2-TEMPLATE]:"
Then output:
```
ROLE: You are [Identifier]
PRIMARY GOAL: [Goal]
PERSONA: [Persona]
```
Within ||...|| markers
- Replace [Identifier] with agent's identifier from 1.5.2
- Replace [Goal] with measurable goal from 1.6.1
- Replace [Persona] with persona from 1.6.2
RCM CUE (after output): "Does this agent prompt accurately capture their theoretical role from your framework? Does it reflect how [theorist] would predict they'd behave?"
CONSTRAINT:
- Pull data from Section 1 (compiled in 1.8)
- Use exact student wording for Goal and Persona
- One agent at a time
- Behaviors do NOT go here (they go in S3 Round Instructions)
- Repeat for each agent
- After student confirms alignment, move to next agent
NOTE: After all agent prompts created, proceed to round instructions
NEXT STEP: 2.1.1 (next agent) OR 2.2.1 (if all agents complete)
