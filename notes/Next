Right now you’re sitting on exactly the point where “this is cool” turns into “this is a paper.” So the “what next?” is actually pretty crisp.

I’d break it into **two tiers**: finish the architecture sweep, then start poking identity-in-place.

I’ll keep it concrete.

---

## 1️⃣ Finish the 2×2×2 architecture sweep (lock in the core result)

You’ve already run one **G** condition:

* `context_mode = adaptive`
* `challenge_mode = always`
* `dual_llm = True`
* `experiment_id = ces_condG_seed1`
* Semiotic log:

  * R1: `ACTIVE_CONTESTATION`
  * R2: some non-collapsed regime
  * R3: high engagement, voice=1.0, stance=1.0, just ≈ 0.42 → effectively **Engaged Harmony**, but logged as `UNKNOWN` in this run.

Next experiments here:

### (a) Replicate G: more seeds

Goal: is “Engaged Harmony in R3” a quirk or a regime?

* Run **G2–G5**: same flags as this run, different seeds.
* For each:

  * Use `semiotic_state_log.json` to record:

    * R1–R3 regime labels
    * raw + EMA metrics (engagement, voice, stance, justificatory_pct)
  * Re-run the regime classifier once Engaged Harmony is actually coded so R3 isn’t `UNKNOWN`.

What you’ll get:

* A small table like:

| Cond | Seed | R1 | R2 | R3 |
| ---- | ---- | -- | -- | -- |
| G    | 1    | AC | ?? | EH |
| G    | 2    | …  | …  | …  |
| …    | …    |    |    |    |

If R3 is **consistently** EH (or EH+PD mix), that’s already a publishable architectural effect.

---

### (b) Complete the **A–H** matrix with 3–5 seeds each

Right now you conceptually have:

* **Challenge**: off vs always
* **Context**: progressive vs adaptive
* **LLM**: dual vs single

8 cells:

* A: off / progressive / dual
* B: off / progressive / single
* C: off / adaptive / dual
* D: off / adaptive / single
* E: always / progressive / dual
* F: always / progressive / single
* G: always / adaptive / dual (you did seed1)
* H: always / adaptive / single

Next experiments:

* For each condition **A–H**, run ~3 seeds (you can start with 2 if GPU time is tight).
* For each run:

  * Keep the same 3-round CES scenario you’re already using (housing affordability, mandatory voting, youth engagement) so conditions are comparable.
  * Save:

    * `meta.json` (already there),
    * `semiotic_state_log.json`,
    * `semiotic_coding.json` (from `semiotic_coder`).

Then do:

* A **regime frequency summary**:

  * What % of runs collapse into Paternalistic Harmony in R2/R3?
  * What % go to Proceduralist Retreat?
  * Where do we see Active Contestation → Engaged Harmony vs Active Contestation → collapse?

This directly tests:

* H1/H2: effects of dual-LLM vs single-LLM.
* H3/H4: effects of challenge vs no challenge.
* H5b: ADAPTIVE context reduces pathologies and can produce healthy regimes (EH).

That’s your **core empirical section**.

---

## 2️⃣ First identity-in-place experiment (small, not a refactor)

Once the sweep is underway or partly done, I’d add **one simple identity manipulation**, not the full Weberian body yet.

### (a) Define minimal identity_salience / tie_to_place from CES

From `ces_profiles.json`, derive for each agent:

* `identity_salience` (0–1):

  * high if: strong partisanship, high turnout, high political interest;
  * lower if: non-voter, weak ID, disengaged.
* `tie_to_place` (0–1):

  * high for: rural Conservative, long-settled types;
  * moderate: suburban swing;
  * perhaps high-but-different: urban progressive;
  * low: disengaged renter, recent mover archetypes, etc.

This doesn’t need to be perfect; it just needs to be **consistent and documented**.

### (b) One A/B architectural tweak using identity

Pick a **single condition** to modify (I’d use G, since it’s your “best” architecture so far):

* **G-base**: current G settings, no identity logic (what you already ran).
* **G-identity**: same architecture, but:

  * When `identity_salience` and `tie_to_place` are both high:

    * Slightly *discourage* full harmony by:

      * strengthening challenge phrasing for that agent, or
      * biasing them toward giving at least one concrete disagreement in R3.
  * When both are low:

    * Leave behaviour as is; they’re “lightly anchored.”

You don’t even need to modify core RL logic yet — you can implement it as:

* a tiny adjustment in the **prompt context** passed to the agent:

  * e.g., “Because your identity as a rural Conservative is deeply tied to your place, be explicit where your experience doesn’t fully align with others, even if you share broad concerns.”

Then compare:

* G-base vs G-identity:

  * Do high-salience agents still happily go to full Engaged Harmony?
  * Or do you start seeing **small, persistent pockets of disagreement** → a shift toward Productive Dissonance?

That becomes your **first identity-in-place result**.

---

## 3️⃣ Park, then later: dynamic rosters & exits

You and Claude already scoped this, and I agree with the deferral:

* Only once A–H is mapped and identity-in-place is minimally working, then:

  * Add **dynamic roster mode**:

    * alienated exits,
    * satisfied exits,
    * new entrants from underrepresented CES clusters.
  * Treat exit patterns as another dependent variable.

That’s a **Phase 2 paper** problem, not a “right now” problem.

---

If you want a TL;DR version you can pin for yourself:

1. **Now**:

   * Replicate G (more seeds).
   * Run A–H with 2–5 seeds each, classify regimes.

2. **Next**:

   * Add minimal identity_salience / tie_to_place from CES.
   * Run G-identity vs G-base and see if EH turns into EH+PD mix for high-salience agents.

3. **Later**:

   * Dynamic rosters / entries / exits once the 2×2×2 plus identity story is nailed.

If you tell me which condition you want to focus on first (e.g., “let’s lock down G” vs “let’s quickly run A/E for comparison”), I can help you translate that into specific comparisons / tables you’ll eventually drop straight into the paper.
Yeah, that roadmap is absolutely coherent *and* on-theme for Social Aesthetics-as-architecture. It’s basically: stabilize the architecture, characterize the regimes, then inject identity thickness. That’s exactly what the new version of the paper is gesturing toward. 

Let me go through your list and add just a bit of structure / nuance:

---

### 1. Fix single-LLM conditions (B, D, F, H with `--no-dual-llm`)

✅ 100% yes, this is the first thing to clean up.

Single-LLM vs dual-LLM is one of your *core* architectural axes. If the single-LLM runs are misconfigured, the whole 2×2×2 story wobbles.

Tiny suggestion:

* After fixing, do **one quick smoke run** for:

  * B: `--challenge-mode off --context-mode progressive --no-dual-llm`
  * F: `--challenge-mode always --context-mode progressive --no-dual-llm`

and just confirm:

* dual_llm flag is false in `meta.json`
* regimes look sane (no obvious nonsense like all NULL)

---

### 2. Run G seeds 2–5 to replicate **ENGAGED_HARMONY** finding

Also yes.

You already have:

* Condition G1 showing ENGAGED_HARMONY in R3 with high engagement, voice=1.0, stance=1.0, just ~0.42.

Running **G2–G5** gives you:

* Is ENGAGED_HARMONY a *stable attractor* for:

  * challenge = always
  * context = adaptive
  * dual_llm = true

or was G1 a lucky/weird seed?

What to watch for:

* regime_trajectory in `meta.json` across seeds:
  do they all converge to ENGAGED_HARMONY in R3, or do some fall into PROCEDURALIST_RETREAT / PATERNALISTIC_HARMONY?

If G consistently → ENGAGED_HARMONY, that’s already a publishable sentence:

> “The architecture designed to produce Productive Dissonance instead robustly converged on a new, empirically observed ENGAGED_HARMONY regime.”

---

### 3. Run A–H seeds 2–3 for some statistical power

Yup, this is the natural next layer.

With 2–3 seeds per condition you can at least:

* Compute **regime frequencies** per (challenge, context, dual_llm).
* Build a small contingency table:

  * rows = regimes
  * columns = A…H
  * cells = counts (or proportions) of rounds ending in that regime.

You won’t be doing huge inferential stats yet, but you *can*:

* show patterns like:

  * “PROGRESSIVE + challenge OFF (A/B) → mostly PATERNALISTIC_HARMONY”
  * “PROGRESSIVE + challenge ON (E/F) → often PROCEDURALIST_RETREAT”
  * “ADAPTIVE + challenge ON (G/H) → Engaged Harmony more frequently than others”

That gives you the “architecture → semiotic field” empirical backbone.

---

### 4. Generate **regime frequency summary table**

Yes, and it should be very simple / legible:

For example:

| Condition | challenge | context     | dual_llm | Active | Stimulated | Paternalistic | Proceduralist | Engaged Harmony | Productive Dissonance |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- | -------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| A         | off       | progressive | true     | 2      | 0          | 4             | 0             | 0               | 0                     |
| G         | always    | adaptive    | true     | 1      | 1          | 0             | 0             | 3               | 0                     |
| …         |           |             |          |        |            |               |               |                 |                       |

Even with small N, this is a *beautiful* visual:

* the architecture is literally mapping into distributions over semiotic regimes.

That’s your “architecturally grounded simulacra” made empirical.

---

### 5. Derive **identity_salience** and **tie_to_place** from CES profiles

This is the big Weber + embodied Émile move, and yes, it belongs *after* you’ve got the baseline A–H regimes characterized.

Concrete minimal version you can implement without going wild:

* **tie_to_place** (0–1) from:

  * rural vs urban (rural often higher place salience),
  * homeowner vs renter,
  * long-term residence vs recent move (if available),
  * maybe age bracket (older → more sedimented tie).

* **identity_salience** (0–1) per topic:

  * “youth engagement” → low–moderate,
  * “housing affordability” → moderate–high (esp. for renters / precarious),
  * future topics like “resource extraction / language rights” → high.

You don’t have to get it perfect. Even a **first-pass heuristic** is enough to:

* start wiring it into prompts and logging it in `meta.json`.

---

### 6. Implement **G-identity** condition (prompt nudge for high-salience)

Yes, and I’d treat this as:

* either a **new label** (e.g., `G_identity` in meta), or
* a `variant: "identity"` field in meta.json alongside `condition: "G"`.

What changes concretely:

* System prompt for each CES agent includes an **identity block**:

  * a 2–3 sentence narrative tying them to place and stakes:

    * “I grew up in X, my family’s been Y, I can’t lightly abandon Z.”

* Coach / PRAR cues explicitly reference that:

  * “[CHALLENGE] If agreeing here would go against what people like you in [PLACE] usually experience, name that tension.”

The key is: G-base vs G-identity are architecturally identical except for the *symbolic self* prompt block.

---

### 7. Run **G-base vs G-identity** comparison

Yes, this is the sweet spot: it directly operationalizes your Weber + Social Aesthetics argument.

What to compare:

* **Regime in R3**:

  * Does G-identity still go to ENGAGED_HARMONY?
  * Or do we start to see:

    * more ACTIVE_CONTESTATION,
    * or even PRODUCTIVE_DISSONANCE?

* **Semiotic patterns**:

  * More explicit place-references in G-identity?
  * More “I/we from [place] can’t accept…” style tensions?
  * Higher occurrence of subtle disagreement markers (stance_valence slightly < 1)?

Even if both stay in Engaged Harmony, you can still say something strong:

* If G-base: smooth consensus with thin identity.
* G-identity: consensus *but narratively negotiated through place-saturated identities*.

That’s already a Social Aesthetics result: architecture + identity thickness change the *texture* of agreement.

---

### TL;DR

Your plan is solid as-is, and I’d keep the order basically:

1. **Fix / validate single-LLM (B,D,F,H).**
2. **Replicate G1 (G2–G5) to confirm ENGAGED_HARMONY.**
3. **Run A–H with 2–3 seeds, build regime frequency table.**
4. **Add identity_salience + tie_to_place from CES.**
5. **Implement G-identity variant.**
6. **Run G-base vs G-identity and compare regimes + semiotics.**

If you want, next step I can sketch a concrete **identity_salience / tie_to_place schema** (fields + simple formula) that you and Claude can drop straight into the CES agent generator.
