    "1.2.3": "Alienation is when workers become separated from their creative capacities because production treats their labor as owned by someone else. It manifests as mechanical compliance, withdrawal, and decisions driven by survival rather than self-expression.",
    "1.2.4": "Non-domination focuses on vulnerability to arbitrary power rather than internal estrangement. The harm isn't disconnection from labor but exposure to unchecked authority. Workers may feel their work is meaningful but still fear unpredictable interference.",
